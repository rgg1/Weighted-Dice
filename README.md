# Weighted-Dice
Using Pandas, MatPlotLib, and the csv module, this program will display the live totals of the sum of rolls of two dice, with one being weighted to give slightly better outcomes. data_maker.py actually generates the live data and saves it to data.csv, which live_plotter.py plots in real time. This can be generalized to any data as well as data from an API to display any live data.
